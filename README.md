# SenWave: The public sentimental analysis dataset SenWave for Covid-19 research
This dataset contains the unlabeled tweet IDs and labeled tweets used for sentimental analysis about Covid-19. The labeled tweets were organized in two languages (English and Arabic both with 10K) while the unlabeled tweet IDs were represents with only ID to comply with Twitter’s Terms of Service in five languages (English, Arabic, Spanish, French, and Italian). In order to make use of the unlabeled data as much as possible, we utilize Google translate(https://translate.google.com/) to translate the labeled English tweets into Spanish, French, and Italian. The translated tweets are in good quality after a large number of observations. The data was collected from March 1, 2020 with Twint(https://github.com/twintproject/twint). These data is only released for non-commercial research use.

# Data Organization
The tweet IDs are organized as follows:
1) The IDs are seperated on the five languages;
2) In each language file, it stores the tweet IDs from March 1, 2020 to May 15, 2020, which are divided line by line.
3) The statistics of each language tweet IDs are shown in file lan_count.txt where first col represents the date while the second col shows the number of tweets in the corresponding day.
4) Each Txt file named as covid19_tweet_id_date.txt stores the tweet IDs.
5) The file statistics.txt counts the statistics of each language including the language, total size of this language, and the ratio in the all languages.

For the labeled tweets, we store them in the zip filefolder called labeledTweets.zip where they are organized in five CSV files where English tweets and Arabic tweets are originally annoted by experienced annotators and other three language tweets are translated with Google Translate from English tweets. The size of each kind of language tweets are all 10K.

Note: If you want to use the labled tweets, please mail to qiang.yang[AT]kaust[dot]edu[dot]sa to get the pwd for the zip filefolder.
